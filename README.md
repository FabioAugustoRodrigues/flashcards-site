This is a Vue.js project that consumes the Flashcards API to provide an interactive tool for studying. The application allows users to review flashcards based on a spaced repetition system (Leitner method) and manage their flashcards through a simple, user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

This project was created to serve as a tool for studying using flashcards. It allows users to:

- Create new flashcards with a question, answer, and examples.
- View, update, and delete existing flashcards.
- Utilize the Leitner method to review flashcards based on their classification and the next review date.

The goal is to provide an effective tool for anyone who wants to study and review concepts efficiently. While the API is private, the project itself is open for modification and further development.

## The application consumes the Flashcards API hosted at:
- API: ```https://api-flashcards.fabioarodrigues.com.br```
